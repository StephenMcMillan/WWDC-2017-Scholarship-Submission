 You've seen how low current effects the circuit simulation but that's boring. So... MORE POWER❗️🔌
 
 **Goal:** Increase the current in the circuit.
 
 Bring up the circuit value adjustment panel and crank up the battery voltage slider. The maximum recommened current for the LED is 26 Milli-Amps but for the purpose of science, just go beyond that. 👀
 
 Interesting results right? The increased current caused the LED to blow because it could not handle the high current in the circuit. This is why resistors are used in circuit boards, to protect components like LEDs from damaging levels of current.
 
 Go ahead and use the Reset button on the circuit view to reset the circuit and continue experimenting.
 
 *When you're ready, I'll wrap up my demo on the next page by showing you how to change the LED colour.*
