 As I said, there is a lot going on when you tap the toggle switch. The circuit model that I have created actually dicates, through calculations, the appropriate state of the circuit. This means that you can change the supply voltage of the battery or value of the resistor and see how these changes effect the circuits operation.
 
 **The changes you are making, closely hold true to how the circuit would behave in real life.**
 
 **Goal:** Increase the value of the resistor until the LED no longer illuminates.
 
 * callout(A Brief Note on Current...):
 Current is the flow of electrons around a circuit. If there are too little electrons flowing around the circuit then the LED will not light up. Current can be lowered by increasing the resistance of a resistor or lowering the supply voltage of the battery.
 
 Double tap the live view to bring up the **circuit value adjustment panel** and increase the resistor value slider until the estimated current is less than 2.5 mA. When you're done with the panel just double tap again to return to the circuit.
 
 When you toggle the switch, the LED should not illuminate. If the resistor value is moderetly but not extremely high then you may notice that the LED operates with decreased brightness.
 
 *When you're ready to move on, we'll look at high current on the next page. It's interesting... ðŸ˜Ž*
