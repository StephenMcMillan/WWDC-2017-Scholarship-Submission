 Hello from Northern Ireland and welcome to my playground, I hope you'll enjoy it! ðŸ‘‹
 
 On the right, you will see a **circuit diagram** which is an illustration of an electronic circuit. This is a fairly simple design compared to what you might see in more advanced electronic products. However, the diagram that i have created is no ordinary circuit diagram! You can interact with it and see how changes in values such as the supply voltage of the battery will effect the operation of the circuit!
 
 If you're unfamiliar with electronics, the components on this board (clockwise from the left) are: a battery, a toggle switch, an LED which lights up and a resistor which restricts the flow of current around the circuit.
 
 **Goal:** Light up the LED. ðŸ’¡
 
 Tap on the toggle switch and you should see the LED or *Light* emitting diode illuminate.
 
 * callout(Fun Fact):
 The sound effect you hear when tapping the toggle switch was recorded from one of the circuits I created myself.
 
 *A lot happens under the hood when you press the toggle switch but I'll explain more about that on the next page when you're ready to move on.*
